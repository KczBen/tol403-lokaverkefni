# Final project in TÃ–L403G for 2025

All of the code is found under `Lokaverkefni.ipynb`, left in their last state before submission. The Python virtual environment in `.venv` contains all dependencies of the project, and was created in Python 3.13.

The interactive maps generated by the code can be found in the HTML files at the root of the repository. Loading the maps requires an active internet connection.
